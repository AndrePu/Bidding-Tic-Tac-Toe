# Bidding-Tic-Tac-Toe
This is modified version of Tic Tac Toe game. For each move you priorly need to set a bid. Player with high bid makes a move. 

Hmm...
This is far different from original game process.

## How to play
0) Initially each of players has four chips for making secret bid with nominals from 1 to 4.
1) First, Player1 has to make a secret bid, only one bid. Then he transfer control to the Player2 which makes its own bid.
2) After two players made their bids it's finding out who is the winner of this round. The winner takes the right to make his own move on field. The loser takes all the bids of the current round.
3) To win the game you need to have horizontally or vertically or maybee diagonally located zeros or crosses.

## WPF version is not completely ready

For now you can:
- Play with your friend on the same PC (two players game)

In Future I promise the game will have:
- One player game (Game with bot);
- Easy level bot;
- Medium level bot;
- Hard level bot.
